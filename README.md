# Kernel-Mode-Driver
C++ Kernel-Mode Driver.

# About
This driver is not meant to be used in any real applications as it is not adequate for them ( easily detected ), it's meant to simply be a basic kernel mode driver which reads and writes from/to processes. This was an educational experience for me and hopefully for anyone who reads this and the code.
I had sort of forgot about this project, and decided to make a few changes to it and release it publicly. Note that this is my first kernel mode driver and it's meant to be a simple one, with basic features and it does not mitigate any detection vectors. Feel free to make any issues or pull requests to improve the code or fix any bugs.
